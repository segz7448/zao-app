/**
 * ZAO - Long-Term Memory Engine
 *
 * This gives ZAO the same kind of persistent, cross-conversation memory
 * Claude/ChatGPT have: durable facts about the person (name, preferences,
 * projects, ongoing context) that are extracted from conversations as they
 * happen and automatically re-injected into every future conversation,
 * without the person ever having to repeat themselves.
 *
 * Three mechanisms:
 *   1. buildMemoryContextBlock() - reads all active memories from SQLite
 *      (src/db/database.js) and formats them into a system message,
 *      injected at the front of `history` for every new conversation.
 *   2. extractMemoriesFromTurn() - after each assistant reply, fires a
 *      background LLM call that looks at the latest exchange and decides
 *      whether it contains a durable fact worth remembering. Runs
 *      fire-and-forget (never blocks the chat UI) and fails silently -
 *      memory extraction is a nice-to-have, never something that should
 *      make a chat response feel slower or riskier. NOTE: since this
 *      shares llamaEngine.js's single resident model slot with normal
 *      chat, if the turn just answered was a coding task (coder model
 *      loaded), this call will trigger a model swap in the background
 *      before it can run - slower than before, but still fire-and-forget
 *      so it never blocks the person from continuing to chat.
 *   3. detectExplicitMemoryCommand() - a fast, local (no LLM call) pattern
 *      match for direct commands like "remember this", "add this to your
 *      memory", "don't forget...", "forget that I...". Unlike #2, this is
 *      deterministic and immediate: if the person explicitly asks ZAO to
 *      remember or forget something, it must actually happen, synchronously,
 *      before ZAO even replies - not "maybe, if the background extraction
 *      model judges it worth it later."
 *
 * Storage is 100% local (SQLite via src/db/database.js) - nothing about a
 * person's memories ever leaves the device except in the outbound prompt
 * sent to whichever model they're chatting with, exactly like the rest of
 * their conversation history already does.

// "large capacity" bank - far more headroom than a person will realistically
// accumulate in casual use.

// EXPLICIT MEMORY COMMANDS - "remember this", "add this to your memory",
// "don't forget to save this", "forget that I...", etc. Matched locally
// with regex (no LLM call, no network) so it's instant and 100% reliable -
// if the person explicitly asks ZAO to remember or forget something, that
// must actually happen every single time, not "probably, if the background
// extraction model agrees it's worth it."
//
// Patterns are intentionally broad (leading TRIGGER phrase, optional
// filler like "to" or "that", then the actual content) since real phrasing
// varies a lot: "remember this: I'm vegetarian", "please remember that I
// prefer dark mode", "add this to your memory - my flight is on the 14th",
// "don't forget to save this to your memory, my API key rotates monthly".
// ============================================================================

// Ordered roughly most-specific-first. Each regex captures the payload
// (the actual fact) in its last capturing group. Case-insensitive, 's' flag
// so '.' matches newlines (people sometimes paste multi-line context after
// the trigger phrase).
