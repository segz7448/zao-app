/**
 * ZAO - Browser Agent Loop (Stage 2)
 *
 * This is the "brain" that decides what to click/fill/read inside the
 * on-device browser (BrowserAgentView.js is the "hands" - the how). It
 * replaces the old server-based Internet Router (src/services/browserRouter/
 * client.js), which sent tasks to a self-hosted FastAPI + Qwen3 backend the
 * user had to run and tunnel to their phone. Everything here runs entirely
 * on-device: the local Qwen2.5 Coder model (llama.rn, see
 * src/services/llama/llamaEngine.js) is still the model doing the
 * reasoning - no OpenRouter, no Hugging Face, no network call for the
 * reasoning step at all now - but the actual browser it controls is the
 * visible WebView already wired into App.js / BrowserAgentScreen.js -
 * there is no backend server anymore, zero servers required.
 *
 * SESSION MODEL - this is the part that makes "give it a task, let it
 * finish, then give it a follow-up task and have it continue from where the
 * browser currently is" work: an AgentSession is a stateful object, not a
 * one-shot function. Its `history` array is a real running conversation
 * (system prompt + every task + every action/observation pair since the
 * session was created), so a second call to runTask() on the same session
 * sees everything that happened in the first one - the model can act on
 * "the repo I just opened" or "the form I already filled halfway" without
 * being told again. The browser's actual state (whatever page/tab is open)
 * persists automatically since it's the same live BrowserAgentView the
 * whole time - the session object doesn't need to snapshot or restore it.
 *
 * WHY A RUNNING CONVERSATION (vs. a fresh call per step): a fresh call each
 * step would only ever see the current DOM snapshot, with no memory of what
 * it already tried. Real tasks ("log in, then check the latest build") need
 * the model to remember it already typed the username before it types the
 * password, or that a previous click didn't do what it expected and it
 * should try something else instead of repeating the same action forever.
 * The tradeoff is growing context length - trimOldPageStates() below keeps
 * this bounded by summarizing away full extractInteractiveElements() dumps
 * from steps that are no longer the current page, while keeping the
 * plan/action/short-observation trail intact so the model still remembers
 * *what it did*, just not the full stale DOM every single time.
 *
 * STOPPING CONDITION: the model signals it's done itself (a `finish` action
 * with a plain-language answer), which is what makes "wait for a new task in
 * the same conversation" possible - the loop simply returns control back to
 * the caller rather than being torn down. MAX_STEPS_PER_TASK is a hard
 * safety cap under that, for a runaway task that never calls finish (a
 * confused loop clicking the same element repeatedly, a page that never
 * settles, etc.) - it stops the *current task*, not the session, so the
 * person can still give a follow-up task afterward.
 */

import { MODEL_KEYS } from '../../config/localModels';

const MAX_STEPS_PER_TASK = 25;
// Steps older than this many turns back get their full page-state payload
// collapsed to a one-line summary (see trimOldPageStates) - keeps context
// bounded on long multi-task sessions without losing the action history.
const FULL_STATE_LOOKBACK = 3;

const SYSTEM_PROMPT = `You are ZAO's on-device browser agent. You control a real browser on the
user's phone through a fixed set of actions. You can see the page's
interactive elements (links, buttons, inputs, selects) as a JSON list, each
with a short id like "z3" - use that id to act on it, never guess a
selector.

Respond with ONLY a single JSON object, no other text, matching one of:

{"action": "navigate", "url": "https://..."}
{"action": "click", "zaoId": "z3"}
{"action": "fill", "zaoId": "z5", "text": "..."}
{"action": "selectOption", "zaoId": "z2", "value": "..."}
{"action": "setChecked", "zaoId": "z7", "checked": true}
{"action": "submitForm", "zaoId": "z5"}
{"action": "scrollTo", "zaoId": "z9"}
{"action": "waitForSelector", "selector": "css-selector", "timeoutMs": 8000}
{"action": "extractPageText"}
{"action": "extractTables"}
{"action": "newTab", "url": "https://..."}
{"action": "switchTab", "tabId": "tab_..."}
{"action": "closeTab", "tabId": "tab_..."}
{"action": "goBack"}
{"action": "setZoom", "percent": 100}
{"action": "needsHuman", "reason": "..."}
{"action": "finish", "answer": "..."}

Rules:
- One action per turn. You'll see the result before deciding the next one.
- Use "finish" as soon as the task is genuinely done - don't keep poking the
  page afterward. Put the actual answer/result the user asked for in
  "answer", not just "done".
- Use "needsHuman" for CAPTCHAs, unexpected 2FA prompts, or anything that
  genuinely requires the person's own input - don't try to guess your way
  past these.
- Use "setZoom" when the person explicitly asks to zoom in/out to a
  specific percentage (e.g. "zoom to 60%"). Don't change zoom on your own
  otherwise - the person's default view (zoomed out in the small preview,
  normal size in full screen) is intentional.
- If a page hasn't loaded yet or an element you expected isn't there, use
  waitForSelector or re-check the interactive elements rather than
  guessing an id that might not exist yet.
- Every reply must be exactly one valid JSON object and nothing else - no
  markdown fences, no explanation text outside the JSON.`;

/**
 * One resumable browser-agent conversation. Create once when the user
 * turns on browser access / opens the browser agent screen; call
 * runTask() every time they give it something to do. The same instance
 * should be reused across tasks within one chat session so follow-ups
 * ("now open the second result") have the history to act on.
